# Customer Support

This is another amazing feature. Customer support, chat support, live support, guest chatting, whatever you say it, would match every situation. If a user is not login into your website, still the user can chat. 

<br>

We call it **Guest Mode** in which user do not need to be login, to chat, they only need to enter their `name` and `email` and continue to chat.

>{primary} Wait. It's much more than that, please continue reading üôèüèª

## Setup Guest Mode

**Guest Mode** is `disabled` by default. You need to set it up first to `enable` it. But before that, it's required to setup and `enable` **User Groups**

>{warning} Read the **User Groups** feature before continuing to below steps.

---

It's very simple to `enable` the **Guest Mode**, you only need to -

1. Go to `Admin Panel -> Settings`
2. Scroll down to **GUEST MODE** section
3. Click on the `Guest Mode` checkbox, to turn it `on/off`
4. Finally, enter the **Guest Group Id** (value), this will be the group who chats with Guests (the user who are not logged in)


>{info} When a Guest sends a message, then it'll be forwarded to all the users in the Guest group, and anyone can reply to the Guest.

---

>{success} When you successfully complete the above step, you'll see a **Guest/Customer Support** tab on the chat widget.

## Guest Login

Let's see how a guest can start chatting without actually logging into your website but by temporarily registering with AddChat Widget (we used cookies for this).

1. When you're not logged into the website, click on the Chat widget
2. The widget form window will open asking you for your `Name` & `Email`, fill it.
3. Click on &nbsp;<larecipe-button type="primary" size="sm" radius="full">Let's Chat</larecipe-button>

<br>

>{primary} When Guest send a message, then all the users in the Guest group will receive the message, and anyone can reply at the same time. Like parallel multi-user chat.

## Guest To Registered User

Auto conversion from Guest to Registered user with all the guest messages restored. Let's explore it more.

<br>

- Suppose a guest entered the `name` & `email` and started chatting and then he/she closed the browser (closed the website)
- The next day the guest again comes to the website, then when he/she open the chat, can continue to conversation where he/she left yesterday
- Now suppose a guest is having conversation with customer support, and after a few messages, he/she **Signup** on your website with the same `email`
- After he/she **Login** into the website and open the Chat widget, then he/she can see all the messages that he/she sent as a **Guest** and can continue where he/she left.


>{primary} This is useful when your leads becomes your customers and want to have a record for everything.
