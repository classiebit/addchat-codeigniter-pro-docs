# Profile

As we've promised, AddChat do not modify any of your website's database. It only fetch information like user id, email, etc. Only those columns that you enter in the `Admin Panel -> Settings`, so no privacy leak, everything in front of you.

>{primary} To manage each user info like Name, profile picture, online status, etc, AddChat do all these thing in its own seperate table.

In the profile, you can manage your-

1. Name
2. Profile picture
3. Online status

>{info} Currently user's `online status` is manage manually by the user. In next version, we'll make it automatic, so that whenever a user is online the status will be updated automatically.
