# Include/Exclude URLs

We've developed Include/Exclude URLs feature, to either exclude AddChat widget from some urls or include it on a few specific urls.

<br>

For Example

1. There are some pages, where we do not want the AddChat widget to show. Like on about us, terms, privacy policy, etc pages. 

1. And if your website is very big, then also you may want to show AddChat widget on a few pages only. Like profile page, product page, etc.

>{danger} You can either use Exclude URL or Include URL at a single time.

---

>{primary} By default it's `Off`, you need to turn it `On` from the `Admin Panel`
