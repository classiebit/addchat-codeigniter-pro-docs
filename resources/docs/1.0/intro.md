<a name="User-Interface-Design"></a>
## User Interface & Design

AddChat is designed in **CSS Flexbox** and **Sass**. Let's see what's so special about **CSS Flexbox** and why we used it.

1. CSS Framework independent. No matter if your website is designed 
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) 
    - [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 
    - [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) 
    - [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) 
    - [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) 

    or any other, we've tested it with all of the above.

2. AddChat CSS is completely encapsulated (wrapped in AddChat wrapper with unique prefix).
    - So it never either override your website design nor inherit from your website design. It always looks as is.
    - It's fully responsive from **extra-small** devices to large **4K desktops**. We've optimized it for-
        - Small phones
        - Phones
        - iPhones
        - iPad
        - iPad Pro
        - Small-Medium-Large screen laptops
        - Large Desktops

3. As it's designed using `Sass`, we've used `auto-prefixer` to keep the design same accross all types of browsers e.g `Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge` etc



>{info} We've used no CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, foundation or any other. Only Flexbox.
